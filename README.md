# Convolutional-Neural-Network(CNN)-Keras

**The repository contains implementation of CNN on some real life use cases.**

Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN or ConvNets) are ordinary neural networks that assume that the inputs are image. They are used to analyze and classify images, cluster images by similarity, and perform object recognition within a frame. For example, convolutional neural networks (ConvNets or CNNs) are used to identify faces, individuals, street signs, tumors, platypuses, and many other aspects of visual data.
